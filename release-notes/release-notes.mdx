<Accordion title="The Versioning Process Explained" icon="git-pull-request-arrow">
  The BYU-Idaho Support Agent platform uses a versioning system where each release increments sequentially (for example 1.9.0 → 1.10.0 → 2.0.0). All version numbers follow the format`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. See the table below:

  | **Version Type** | **Example**     | **Changes**                                                                                                                                                         |
  | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Major**        | v1 → v2         | Complete UI redesign, Major architectural changes, Significant new capabilities (e.g., adding voice agents), Strategic milestones (e.g., "Phase 2" of the platform) |
  | **Minor**        | v1.6 → v1.7     | New features, New integrations, Notable improvements                                                                                                                |
  | **Patch**        | v1.7.0 → v1.7.1 | Bug fixes, Security patches, Performance tweaks, Minor text/UI adjustments                                                                                          |

## Version 1.1.0 - Minor Release
### What's New

Post-launch improvements focused on three key areas: smarter live agent handoff that remembers your login information, dramatically faster response times (from 8+ seconds to under 1 second), and new campus integration tools. This release also includes critical security patches and establishes proper release management processes for future updates.

### Features

**Live Agent Handoff Improvements**

- Auto-populate your name and email from login session—no more redundant questions when connecting to a live agent
- Campus directory lookup tool for searching BYU-Idaho contacts and departments
- Holiday hours mode for configurable business hours (M-F 8 AM - 5 PM during holidays vs normal operating hours)

**User Experience**

- Browser notifications for unread messages while browsing other tabs
- Interactive onboarding tutorial for new users
- Role-based quick actions tailored to your user type (student, employee)
- Loading indicators during AI response generation

### Improvements

**Live Agent Handoff**

- Enhanced WebSocket connection stability and timeout prevention
- Improved session persistence with Redis-based tracking
- Better correlation ID handling for handoff state management
- Enhanced SSE keepalive with heartbeat yielding to prevent disconnections

**Frontend**

- Code splitting and lazy loading for faster initial page loads
- Enhanced source display showing citations for tool executions
- Better error messages across all agent interactions

### Bug Fixes

**Live Agent Handoff**

- Fixed issue where agent repeatedly asked for name and email despite having this information from your login profile
- Resolved session persistence problems during handoff
- Fixed WebSocket resource leaks
- Corrected handoff detection tool naming

**UI & Display**

- Resolved message duplication in chat interface
- Fixed duplicate tool cards appearing in responses
- Corrected TypeScript strict mode errors
- Updated chat placeholders and hover states for better clarity

### Performance

- **Sub-second response times**: Switched to SQLAlchemySession, reducing response time from 8-11 seconds to under 1 second
- **Faster startup**: Removed bottlenecks at application startup
- **Improved frontend loading**: Code splitting and lazy loading reduce initial page load time

### Security

**Critical Updates**

- React 19.2.1 upgrade (CVE-2025-55182 Critical RCE fix)
- mdast-util-to-hast 13.2.1 (CVE-2025-66400 fix)
- Multiple dependency security updates

**Enhancements**

- Improved FERPA and academic integrity guardrails

### Technical

**Documentation**

- CHANGELOG.md with complete release history
- Release management documentation
- Deployment rollback procedures
- ACR cleanup documentation

**ACR Image Tags**: `v1.1.0`
