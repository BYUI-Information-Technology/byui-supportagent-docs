<Accordion title="The Versioning Process Explained" icon="git-pull-request-arrow">
  The BYU-Idaho Support Agent platform uses a versioning system where each release increments sequentially (for example 1.9.0 → 1.10.0 → 2.0.0). All version numbers follow the format`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. See the table below:

  | **Version Type** | **Example**     | **Changes**                                                                                                                                                         |
  | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Major**        | v1 → v2         | Complete UI redesign, Major architectural changes, Significant new capabilities (e.g., adding voice agents), Strategic milestones (e.g., "Phase 2" of the platform) |
  | **Minor**        | v1.6 → v1.7     | New features, New integrations, Notable improvements                                                                                                                |

## Version 1.4.0 - Minor Release
## What's New

This release introduces MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration, replacing custom function tools with a centralized toolkit approach. The backend now connects to an n8n-hosted MCP server that provides knowledge tools including Knowledge Base Search, Academic Calendar, Portals and Resources, and Campus Directory. Performance improvements include priority routing for faster API response times.

## Highlights

- **MCP Server Integration**: Replaced 4 custom function tools with a unified MCP server toolkit
- **Priority API Routing**: Added OpenAI priority service tier for faster response times
- **Streaming Fix**: Resolved AttributeError in AgentUpdatedStreamEvent handling
- **Code Reduction**: Removed ~400 lines of legacy tool code

## Features

**Backend - MCP Server Integration**

- Integrate Support Agent Toolkit MCP server for knowledge tools (agent.py)
- Add MCP server lifecycle management with proper connection handling (agent.py)
- Bearer token authentication for secure MCP endpoint communication

**Backend - Performance**

- Add `service_tier="priority"` for faster API response times via OpenAI priority routing

## Technical Changes

**Tool Architecture Refactor**

- Replace custom function tools with single MCP server integration
- Migrate from direct Pinecone/Redis calls to centralized n8n MCP endpoint
- Tools now use `mcp_servers` parameter in Agent constructor instead of `tools` parameter
- Update system prompt to reference MCP server tools
- Add `MCPServerStreamableHttp` import from `agents.mcp`

## Bug Fixes

**Streaming Event Handler**

- Fix `AttributeError: 'AgentUpdatedStreamEvent' object has no attribute 'item'`
- Ensure all `event.item.type` checks are properly nested inside `run_item_stream_event` block
- Add clarifying comments to prevent future indentation issues

## Highlights

- **Removed Material UI**: Replaced all MUI components with shadcn/ui equivalents, reducing bundle size by ~44 packages
- **ShinyText Animation**: Added animated "Thinking..." text with star border glow effect during AI reasoning
- **Dark Mode Consistency**: Toast notifications now match the dark theme background color

- Add StarBorder component for animated border effects (StarBorder.tsx, StarBorder.css)

**Frontend - Toast Notifications**

- Replace MUI Snackbar/Alert with sonner toast notifications (ChatMessage.tsx)
- Add comprehensive dark mode styling for sonner toasts (index.css)
- Reposition toast close button inside component (shadcn/ui style)

## Improvements

**Frontend - UI Consistency**

- Fix quick action card heights to be uniform regardless of content length (Chat.tsx, StarBorder.css)
- Fix chat input alignment to match quick action cards width (Chat.tsx)
- Fix avatar border stretching by adding flex-shrink-0 (ChatMessage.tsx)
- Add indeterminate progress animation for tool activity indicator (ToolActivityBar.tsx, index.css)

**Backend - Agent Updates**

- Update agent prompt and configuration (agent.py, prompt.py)

## Technical Changes

**Dependency Removal**

- Remove @mui/material, @emotion/react, @emotion/styled dependencies
- Remove MUI vendor chunk from Vite build configuration (vite.config.ts)
- Add motion package for ShinyText animations
- Update package-lock.json with reduced dependencies

**Styling Updates**

- Add CSS custom properties for sonner toast dark mode styling
- Update StarBorder CSS to use flex display for proper height inheritance
- Add progress-indeterminate keyframe animation
