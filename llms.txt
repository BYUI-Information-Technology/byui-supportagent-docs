# BYUI Support Agent

> An AI-powered multi-agent system designed to assist BYU-Idaho students, faculty, and staff with support inquiries through intelligent orchestration, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and seamless escalation to human support.

## Overview

The BYUI Support Agent is a production-level AI application that provides fast, accurate, and values-aligned responses to common support questions. The system uses advanced AI orchestration to autonomously route inquiries, retrieve knowledge from verified sources, and escalate to human agents when necessary.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Intelligent question answering using GPT-5.1 and vector search
- Multi-agent orchestration for complex queries
- Real-time web research for current information
- Automatic escalation to Genesys Cloud live agents
- Ticket creation in TeamDynamix for asynchronous support
- FERPA and academic integrity compliance guardrails

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend: Python with OpenAI Agents SDK and FastAPI
- Frontend: React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- AI Models: GPT-5.1 (OpenAI API)
- Vector Database: Pinecone
- Authentication: Church Account SSO
- Infrastructure: Azure Container Apps, PostgreSQL, Key Vault

## Architecture

The Support Agent uses a multi-agent orchestration system with the following components:

**Primary Agent (Triage):**
- Handles general inquiries and routing decisions
- Determines when to escalate or delegate to specialized agents
- Manages conversation context and memory

**Specialized Agents:**
- Knowledge Base Agent: Retrieves information from Genesys Cloud knowledge base via Pinecone vector search
- Web Research Agent: Performs real-time web searches using Tavily API
- Escalation Agent: Creates tickets in TeamDynamix or routes to live Genesys agents

**Custom Tools:**
- Academic calendar lookup (Firecrawl API)
- Portal and resource directory (JSON lookup)
- Campus directory search
- Live agent handoff (Genesys Cloud)
- Ticket creation (TeamDynamix)

## Integration Points

**External Systems:**
- Genesys Cloud: Knowledge base ingestion and live agent escalation
- TeamDynamix: Support ticket creation and tracking
- Church Account: Single sign-on authentication
- Pinecone: Vector database for semantic search
- OpenAI API: Language model generation
- Azure Services: PostgreSQL (conversation history), Key Vault (secrets), Container Apps (hosting)

## API Endpoints

The backend API is not publicly documented as it's designed for internal use by the frontend application. The primary interaction method is through the web chat interface at:

**Production:** https://supportagent.byui.edu
**Development:** https://supportagent-dev.byui.edu

## Compliance & Guardrails

The Support Agent implements several compliance measures:

**FERPA Protection:**
- Does not access or display student educational records
- Redirects requests for personal information to authenticated channels

**Academic Integrity:**
- Refuses to complete homework or provide test answers
- Guides students to appropriate learning resources

**Escalation Criteria:**
- Complex technical issues requiring hands-on support
- Account access or password reset requests
- Financial aid or billing inquiries requiring verification
- Any request involving sensitive personal information

## Usage Guidelines

When interacting with information about the Support Agent:

1. **Respect Privacy:** The system does not expose student data or personal information
2. **Acknowledge Limitations:** This is a beta system with known limitations (see Beta Disclosure)
3. **Verify Critical Information:** Always direct users to official channels for critical matters
4. **Understand Scope:** The agent focuses on common support questions, not specialized technical support

## Source Code

The project is open source (internal to BYU-Idaho):
- Repository: https://github.com/BYUI-Information-Technology/Support-Agent
- License: Internal use only
- Contact: BYU-Idaho IT Department

## Additional Context

**Deployment Model:**
- Production environment serves the main BYU-Idaho student population
- Development environment for testing and validation
- Containerized deployment using Docker and Azure Container Apps
- Secrets managed through Azure Key Vault
- Conversation history stored in Azure PostgreSQL

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Streaming responses for real-time interaction
- Vector search latency: <500ms for most queries
- Agent orchestration decision time: <2s for typical handoffs
- 99.9% uptime SLA on Azure Container Apps
