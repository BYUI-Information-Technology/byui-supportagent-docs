### Best Practices for Getting Help

- **Be Specific:** The more details you give, the better the answer (e.g., “I can't log into my email” vs. “I forgot my BYUI email password”).
- **Explore Follow-ups:** After the agent responds, you can ask for clarification or a related question without starting over.
- **Escalating Issues:** For complex or account-sensitive issues (like forgotten security answers), the agent will suggest next steps—such as contacting the BYUI Support Center.

### Important Notices

- **Beta Disclaimer:** The system is in Beta, so answers may not always be perfect. Always verify critical information if unsure.
- **Data Privacy:** No personal data is stored between sessions. Use the “Clear Memory” button to delete your conversation history during your chat only.

---

### Troubleshooting and Tips

- **No Response?** Ensure you have a stable internet connection and refresh the page if you experience issues.
- **Getting Stuck:** Click the three dots in the top right corner of the chat interface and select "Clear Memory", then refresh the page.
