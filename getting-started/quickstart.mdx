## Best Practices for Getting Help

- **Be Specific:** The more details you give, the better the answer (e.g., “I can't log into my email” vs. “I forgot my BYUI email password”).
- **Explore Follow-ups:** After the agent responds, you can ask for clarification or a related question without starting over.
- **Escalating Issues:** For complex or account-sensitive issues (like forgotten security answers), the agent will suggest next steps—such as contacting the BYUI Support Center.
