## Why AI-Optimized Documentation Matters

Traditional documentation sits in isolation. You read it, take notes, and if you want to explore a concept deeper or ask questions, you need to copy content manually into ChatGPT or Claude, losing context along the way.

AI-native documentation eliminates that friction. Every page on this site can be instantly shared with AI assistants in the exact format they understand best—preserving structure, context, and meaning. This means:

- **Faster Learning**: Ask follow-up questions without retyping content
- **Deeper Understanding**: Get AI-powered explanations tailored to your knowledge level
- **Better Research**: Combine documentation with AI reasoning for complex topics
- **Seamless Workflow**: Move between reading and AI-assisted learning with one click

This approach aligns with BYU-Idaho's AI initiative: we're not just teaching about AI—we're building systems that make AI tools accessible and useful for everyday learning.

## Built-In AI Features: The Contextual Menu

Every page on this documentation site includes a **contextual menu** (accessed via the "Copy page" button in the top-right corner) that provides quick access to AI-optimized content and direct integrations with popular AI tools. When you select the contextual menu, you can copy content as context for AI tools or open conversations in ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity with the documentation already loaded as context.

### Copy Page as Markdown for LLMs

This feature copies the current page as clean, structured Markdown—the format AI language models understand best. Unlike copying raw HTML or formatted text, Markdown preserves:

- Document structure (headings, lists, code blocks)
- Semantic meaning (emphasis, links, references)
- Hierarchical relationships between concepts

**When to use it**: You want to paste documentation into your own AI assistant (like ChatGPT, Claude, or another tool) while preserving full context and structure.

**Example use case**: You're reading about RAG chunking strategies and want to ask Claude to create a custom chunking strategy for your research project. Copy the page as Markdown, paste it into Claude, and ask your question with full context intact.

### View as Markdown

Opens the page as plain text Markdown in a new tab. This gives you a clean, readable view of the content without styling or navigation elements.

**When to use it**: You want to read documentation distraction-free, copy specific sections easily, or see the raw content structure.

**Example use case**: You're writing a paper about RAG technology and need to quote sections from the documentation. View as Markdown to see clean text without web formatting.

### Open in ChatGPT

Launches ChatGPT with the current page already loaded as context, ready for you to ask questions.

**When to use it**: You want immediate AI-powered help understanding the page without manually copying content.

**Example use case**: You're reading about LLM alignment but don't fully understand the concept. Click "Open in ChatGPT" and ask: "Can you explain this concept using an analogy related to student advising at a university?"

### Open in Claude

Same as the ChatGPT integration, but uses Anthropic's Claude assistant instead.

**When to use it**: You prefer Claude's reasoning style or want a second AI perspective on the same content.

**Example use case**: You've already asked ChatGPT about prompt engineering but want Claude's take on the same documentation for comparison.

### Open in Perplexity

Launches Perplexity AI with the page loaded, combining the documentation with Perplexity's real-time web search capabilities.

**When to use it**: You want to explore the topic beyond this documentation, finding related research, examples, or current developments.

**Example use case**: You're reading about vector embeddings and want to find recent academic papers or industry examples beyond what's covered in the docs.

### Copy MCP Server URL

Copies the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server URL to your clipboard. MCP is an emerging standard that allows AI assistants to connect directly to data sources and tools.

**When to use it**: You're using an AI assistant that supports MCP connections and want to give it direct access to this documentation.

**Example use case**: You're building a custom AI assistant for your team and want it to have real-time access to Support Agent documentation without manual copying.

## How to Use the Contextual Menu

### Basic Workflow: Read + Ask

1. **Read the documentation** normally until you encounter something you want to explore deeper
2. **Click "Copy page"** in the top-right corner to open the AI features menu
3. **Choose your AI assistant** (ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity)
4. **Ask your question** in the AI interface that opens—the page content is already loaded as context

The AI assistant now has full context about what you're reading and can provide personalized explanations, examples, or deeper dives.

### Advanced Workflow: Research with AI

When researching a complex topic across multiple documentation pages:

1. **Use "View as Markdown"** to scan pages quickly in plain text
2. **Copy relevant pages as Markdown** and combine them in a single AI conversation
3. **Ask synthesis questions** like: "Based on these three articles about RAG, chunking, and embeddings, explain how the Support Agent processes a student's question step-by-step"

This lets you leverage AI to connect concepts across documentation in ways that would take hours manually.

### Workflow for Students: Study Aid

Preparing for a project or learning AI concepts for class:

1. **Read the documentation page** on the relevant topic
2. **Open in your preferred AI assistant** (ChatGPT or Claude)
3. **Ask for study materials**: "Create 5 quiz questions based on this content" or "Explain this concept at a high school level"
4. **Request examples**: "Give me 3 real-world examples of this technology being used at universities"

The AI becomes a personalized tutor with full context about what you're studying.

## Best Practices

### Use the Right Tool for the Job

- **ChatGPT**: Conversational explanations, creative examples, brainstorming applications
- **Claude**: Deep reasoning, structured analysis, nuanced explanations
- **Perplexity**: Finding external resources, current research, real-world examples

### Combine Markdown with Specific Questions

Don't just paste documentation into AI assistants without direction. After loading content, ask specific questions:

**Weak**: "Tell me about this."

**Strong**: "I'm a BYU-Idaho student with no AI background. Explain vector embeddings from this page using an analogy related to the university library system."

### Preserve Context Across Conversations

When exploring a topic across multiple pages, keep the same AI conversation open and add new pages to it. This builds cumulative context and lets the AI connect concepts.

### Verify Information

AI assistants can make mistakes or hallucinate details. When they reference the documentation, verify by checking the original page. The documentation is the authoritative source—AI assistants are exploration tools.

### Share Your Learning

If an AI assistant helps you understand a concept particularly well, share that explanation with classmates or colleagues. This documentation site enables collaborative learning powered by AI.
