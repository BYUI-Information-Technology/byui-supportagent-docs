The "**BYUI Support Agent**" or simply "**Support Agent**" is an advanced **multi-agent generative AI system** developed by AI engineers at BYU-Idaho to help students and employees of **Brigham Young University-Idaho** quickly find answers to common support questions. As of December 2025, the platform is accessible via the embedded [chat widget](/technical/chat-widget.mdx) on all byui.edu websites.

This initiative represents a significant evolution from BYU-Idaho's previous FAQ chatbot, which was built on the Genesys Dialog Engine Bot Flows. The new Support Agent offers a more adaptive, intelligent, and scalable approach to student engagement—improving accuracy and accessibility while reducing the workload on Support Center staff.

## Why We Built This

The BYU-Idaho Support Center is tasked with supporting a larger student population with fewer staff. However, resource constraints limit the ability of staff to provide the level of support that is needed for the rising demand. The Support Agent addresses this challenge by providing:

- **After-Hours Support**: AI-assisted help available 24/7 for general university questions
- **Reduced Staff Workload**: High-accuracy self-service reduces the load on first-level support agents
- **Faster Response Times**: Students get instant answers without waiting in queue
- **Personalized Support**: Context-aware responses tailored to each student's situation
- **Focus on Complex Issues**: Support Center staff can dedicate more time to complex student needs requiring human interaction

## How It Works

Powered by [**OpenAI GPT-5.2**](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/) and [retrieval augmented generation (RAG)](/learn/rag/what-is-rag) technology, the "Support Agent" is an AI agent that draws from a comprehensive knowledge base curated by the BYU-Idaho Support Center's staff to provide accurate, grounded responses based on official knowledge sources.

## What is an AI agent?

The same LLM technology that powers ChatGPT can also serve as the foundation for an "Agent." Unlike a simple chatbot, an AI agent can **_reason about requests and take meaningful actions_** with a **_degree of autonomy_**. This is possible because agents can be **_connected to campus systems and tools_**—such as knowledge bases, academic calendars, student records, or service portals—and then use those resources to complete tasks.

For example, an AI agent at BYU-Idaho could:

- Look up an upcoming registration deadline on the academic calendar for a student.
- Search academic policies and submit a ticket for a student with an unresolved concern.
- Assist IT by triaging support requests before routing them to staff.

These agents don't replace people—they extend the university's ability to serve. They operate under clear guardrails, working alongside faculty and staff to reduce repetitive workloads and provide students with faster, more consistent support.

The BYUI Support Agent takes this concept further by using **multiple agents working together**. Instead of a single agent trying to do everything, specialized agents handle specific tasks (like searching the knowledge base, researching current policies, or deciding when to escalate to a human). This multi-agent approach provides more accurate, reliable, and contextually appropriate responses.

### Multi-Agent Architecture

Unlike traditional chatbots that follow rigid decision trees, the Support Agent uses a **multi-agent orchestration framework** where specialized AI agents collaborate autonomously to deliver accurate, compliant, and contextually aware responses.

The Support Agent is built using the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/), which enables the creation of completely agentic systems for tasks ranging from simple question answering to complex multi-agent orchestration.

- **Gaurdrail Agent**: Dedicated to monitoring and safegaurding data privacy, reducing risk for harm, and blocking illegal, unethical, and harmful activity
- **Support Agent**: Dedicated to frontline university support for both students and employees
- **Research Agent**: Subagent that specializes in conducting research. This agent is currently configured to help students learn about AI tools that can help them in the future career fields

Using the OpenAI Agents SDK allowed to to build a future-proof, agentic system that can extend to additional departments, integrate with existing systems, automate and complete tasks, and serve as a platform for other AI agents.

This modular design means the system can easily be extended to support additional departments and integrate with more campus systems over time.

Additional Agents:

- Career & Academic Advising
- Financial Aid
- Advising

## Primary Objectives

In order to successfully implement this initiative, the following primary objectives are essential:

- **Leverage AI**: Leverage the advantages of generative artificial intelligence such as cost, availability, consistency, and speed for common support tasks like question answering.
- **Build agent-centric**: Build a future-proof, agentic system that can extend to additional departments, integrate with existing systems, automate and complete tasks, and serve as a platform for other AI agents.
- **Align with BYU-Idaho Values**: Build an agent that is aligned with the values of BYU-Idaho, including the Honor Code, and is designed to help students and employees at BYU-Idaho.
- **Be Measurable**: Build an agent that is measurable and can be evaluated to ensure it is meeting the needs of students and employees at BYU-Idaho. In other words, we must be able to measure the success of the agent and make improvements based on the data.

## Evolution from Previous System

The Support Agent represents a fundamental shift from the university's previous approach to automated support:

| Feature              | Previous System (Genesys) | Support Agent                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture**     | Intent-based NLU          | Generative AI (RAG + Agents)         |
| **Maintenance**      | Manual intent training    | Dynamic learning from knowledge base |
| **Flexibility**      | Rigid flow design         | Adaptive multi-agent orchestration   |
| **Scalability**      | Limited                   | Modular and department-expandable    |
| **Response Context** | Static                    | Context-aware with real-time lookups |

This shift from **intent-based AI** to **contextual generative AI** enables the system to support more nuanced, natural, and scalable conversations across all support domains.

## Future Expansion

The Support Agent is designed as a platform that can grow with the university's needs. Future phases may include:

- **Department-specific agents**: Specialized sub-agents for Financial Aid, Admissions, Student Records, and Advising
- **Enhanced integrations**: Direct connections to more campus systems for automated task completion
- **Expanded capabilities**: Proactive notifications, appointment scheduling, and personalized recommendations
- **Cross-department collaboration**: Multiple department agents working together to solve complex student needs

The modular architecture ensures that new capabilities can be added without disrupting existing functionality.
