The "**BYUI Support Agent**" or simply "**Support Agent**" is an advanced **agentic AI system** developed by AI engineers at BYU-Idaho to help the students and employees of **Brigham Young University-Idaho** quickly find answers to common support questions.

This platform is an evolution from the previous "chatbot", that it now replaces, that was built using scripted rules that were rigid and predefined. The new Support Agent offers a more adaptive, intelligent, scalable approach to user support—improving accuracy and accessibility while simultaneously reducing the workload on support personnel.

## Why We Built This

Central to the mission of the university is to serve, "...as *many students as possible* within *resource constraints*," while simultaneously..."delivering education that is *affordable* for students and the Church." The Support Agent uniquely follows the university's mission by providing:

- Support that **scales instantly** as demand increases from forces such as increased enrollment or surges around campus deadlines (like finals or start-of-semester). AI unaffected by changes in volume or demand.
- Information to users that is **accurate and tailored** to the needs of the BYUI students and staff that doesn't sacrifice **quality**.
- Low-cost 

- **After-Hours Support**: AI-assisted help available 24/7 for general university questions
- **Reduced Staff Workload**: High-accuracy self-service reduces the load on first-level support agents
- **Faster Response Times**: Students and staff get instant answers without waiting in queue
- **Personalized Support**: Context-aware responses tailored to each user's situation, knowing when it's conversing with an employee vs student
- **Focus on Complex Issues**: Support Center staff can dedicate more time to complex student needs requiring human interaction

## How It Works

Powered by the latest models from [**OpenAI**](https://openai.com/) and [retrieval augmented generation (RAG)](/learn/rag/what-is-rag) technology, the "Support Agent" is an AI agent that draws from a comprehensive knowledge base that's both curated and maintained by the BYU-Idaho Support Center's staff to provide accurate, grounded responses based on official, verified information.

**What the BYUI Support Agent can do:**

- **Reason through your question.** It analyzes what you actually need, even when your phrasing is conversational or imprecise. This is why you see the "Thinking..." indicator after your ask the agent a question.
- **Search official knowledge sources.** It retrieves information directly from BYU-Idaho's policies, procedures, and support documentation—not from generic internet content or from it's own pre-training knowledge.
- **Use tools to help you.** It can search for specific policies, look up procedures, and create support tickets when you need human assistance.
- **Recognize its limits.** When a question requires human expertise or falls outside its capabilities, it seamlessly connects you with a live support specialist.
- **Remember context.** It tracks the flow of your conversation, so you do not need to repeat yourself.

## Integrated with Campus Systems

The Support Agent is connected to key campus systems to provide seamless support:

- **Genesys Cloud**: For live agent escalation when human assistance is needed
- **Pinecone**: Enterprise-grade vector database for fast, accurate knowledge retrieval
- **Microsoft**: Built on Microsoft's enterprise ecosystem for reliability, security, and scalability
