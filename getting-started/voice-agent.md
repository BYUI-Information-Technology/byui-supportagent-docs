**Welcome!** The BYUI Support Agent now supports voice interaction—making it even easier to get campus support hands-free. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started.

<br />

### Accessing the Voice Interface

- Go to [https://supportagent.byui.edu/voice](https://supportagent.byui.edu/voice){:target="\_blank"} in your web browser.
- You’ll be greeted by the Voice Support interface.

### Preparing to Use Voice

- **Microphone Permissions:** When prompted, make sure to allow your browser to access your microphone so you can speak to the Support Agent.
- **Audio Setup:** Confirm your device volume and microphone are working. Headphones with a mic are recommended for privacy and clarity.

### Getting Help

- **Speak Clearly:** After starting a call, state your question or describe your support need (for example, “How do I access my BYUI Canvas account?”).
- **Listen:** The agent will respond aloud. If you need the answer repeated, just ask!
- **Follow Up:** You can ask additional questions or clarify your issue during the same call session.

---

### Best Practices

- **Be Specific:** Provide detailed information for more accurate answers.
- **Use Simple Commands:** Short, clear questions are easiest for the voice agent to understand.
- **Stay Patient:** There may be a brief pause while the agent processes your request.

### Troubleshooting and Tips

- **No audio captured**:
  - Ensure the browser has microphone permission (look for the camera/mic icon in the address bar)
  - Check device settings for microphone permission
  - Refresh the page and try again; try a wired or USB headset
- **Can't hear the agent**:
  - Check your device volume and output device settings
  - Make sure the site tab is not muted
  - Some browsers block autoplay—interact with the page (click) to enable audio
- **Connection issues**:
  - Try another network, or reload the page
  - Use a modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)

### Important Notices

- **Beta Version:** The voice system is in Beta. There may be occasional glitches or misunderstandings—repeat your question or try rephrasing if needed.
- **Privacy:** Your voice is not stored after the session ends. Use “Clear Memory” to delete your conversation history during your chat and start fresh.
- **Escalation:** If your issue is unresolved or urgent, the agent will guide you on how to contact the BYU-Idaho Support Center.
