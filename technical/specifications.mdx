## System Overview

The BYU-Idaho Support Agent is an enterprise-grade AI-powered student support system designed to provide instant, accurate, and values-aligned responses to student inquiries. The system leverages state-of-the-art language models, vector search capabilities, and cloud-native architecture to deliver 24/7 support services.

## Core Components

### React + TypeScript (Frontend)

The user interface is built with [React](https://react.dev/learn) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). **React** is the industry-standard for building modern, responsive web apps. It enables component-based development, rapid prototyping, and easy state management. Developed by Facebook, React is a powerful tool for building complex user interfaces that are easy to maintain and scale.

**TypeScript** adds type safety to JavaScript, which drastically reduces bugs, increases maintainability, and is highly favored by senior developers for larger or mission-critical applications. Developed by Microsoft, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, which helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.

Here are some of the key takeaways:

- Single-page application providing the user interface
- Real-time streaming chat interface with markdown support
- Responsive design supporting desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Theme management (light/dark/terminal modes)
- Markdown support for rich text formatting

### Python + FastAPI (Backend)

The backend is built with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). **Python** has become the de facto standard for AI and machine learning applications, powering everything from research prototypes to production-scale systems at organizations like Google, Meta, and OpenAI. Its dominance in the AI space stems from several key strengths:

- **Rich AI Ecosystem:** Native support for industry-leading frameworks including OpenAI Agents SDK, Claude Agent SDK (Claude Code), Model Context Protocol (MCP), LangChain, CrewAI, Hugging Face Transformers, scikit-learn, and more
- **Simplicity and Readability:** Clean, expressive syntax that prioritizes developer productivity and code maintainability
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Dynamic typing and extensive standard library enable quick iteration and experimentation
- **Scientific Computing:** Robust support for numerical operations, data manipulation, and statistical analysis through NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy
- **Community and Resources:** Largest community of AI/ML practitioners, ensuring extensive documentation, tutorials, and third-party libraries

Python's integration with cutting-edge AI services makes it the optimal choice for building intelligent applications that require seamless interaction with language models, vector databases, and other AI infrastructure.

### OpenAI Agents SDK (Python)

The AI agent system is built and orchestrated with the **OpenAI Agents SDK**, a powerful tool for building AI agents. The [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) is an official OpenAI framework that allows for the creation of completely agentic systems for tasks ranging from simple question answering to complex multi-agent orchestration systems. It lays the groundwork for future advancements in AI-powered support systems, making it a valuable asset for expansion into multi-agent systems.

#### SDK Features

- Agentic architecture with tool-calling capabilities
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for knowledge grounding
- Multi-agent system with specialized sub-agents
- Context-aware session and memory management
- Gaurdrails for ethical and secure behavior
- Tracing and logging for monitoring, evaluation, and fine-tuning
