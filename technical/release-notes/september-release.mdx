## First Release 🚀

This is the first release of the BYUI Support Agent. It is a beta release and is available to students, employees, and visitors to BYU-Idaho for limited time. This release features the chat and voice chat interfaces, a visually appealing home page, and a comprehensive documentation website (this resource).

This release was a collaborative effort between the BYU-Idaho Information Technology team and the BYU-Idaho Support Center. The Support Center provided feedback and testing for this release.

The BYU-Idaho Information Technology team is responsible for the development and maintenance of the BYUI Support Agent. The team is comprised of Ron Vallejo, the project lead and AI engineer.

### Features

- **Advanced AI Agent**: The Support Agent was built using the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/){:target="\_blank"}, a powerful Python framework for building AI agentic applications. This framework allows us to build a multi-agent system with specialized sub-agents, each with their own set of tools and capabilities.
- **Multi-Modal Support**: The Support Agent supports both text and voice chat.
- **Chat Interface**: The chat interface allows students, employees, and visitors to BYU-Idaho to ask questions and get instant AI-powered responses. It is powered by GPT-4.1 and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology.
- **Voice Chat Interface**: The voice chat interface features a familiar phone call experience that's integrated with the Realtime API from OpenAI, featuring voice responses in real-time through the user's microphone. The voice chat interface is available in the browser and on mobile devices. It is powered by GPT-4.1 and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology and features the brand-new "[gpt-realtime](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-realtime/){:target="\_blank"}" model from OpenAI using the new voice "Marin".
- **Home Page**: The home page is a visually appealing landing page that introduces the Support Agent and provides a call to action for users to start chatting.
- **Documentation Website**: This website is a comprehensive documentation website that provides information about the BYUI Support Agent, including user guides, technical specifications, and release notes. The documentation website is built with MkDocs using the [shadcn theme for MkDocs](https://github.com/asiffer/mkdocs-shadcn){:target="\_blank"} and hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.
