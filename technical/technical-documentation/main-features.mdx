## Tools

A key difference between a vanilla "chatbot" and an "AI Agent" lies in the orchestration of tools.

Think of an AI agent as a very capable assistant. On its own, it can think, reason, and talk. **Tools** are the things it can _use_ to actually get stuff done in the real world.

A helpful metaphor is a human at a desk.

Your brain is great at planning, deciding, and explaining. But when you need to send an email, check a calendar, look up a file, or calculate a budget, you reach for tools. A keyboard, a browser, a calculator, a phone. Without them, you would be stuck thinking about work instead of doing it. AI agent tools work the same way.

A tool is simply **a permissioned action the AI can take outside its own head**. Instead of just answering using generic knowledge, the agent can:

- Look something up
- Send messages
- Update records
- Trigger workflows
- Call other software systems

The key idea is this: **tools turn the AI from a chatbot into an autonomous "AI agent"**. Without tools, an AI can say, "Here’s how you should do this." With tools, it can say, "I’ve done it."

Importantly, tools are not magical or autonomous. They are tightly defined. Each tool says, in effect, “You may do this one specific thing.” The agent chooses whether to use a tool, when to use it, and how, but it cannot go beyond what the tool allows. That keeps things safe and predictable.

Here is a concrete, everyday example.

If you ask the Support Agent, “How do I get a parking pass?,” the thinking part figures out the intent. The tool is what the agent uses to find an answer, and provide the correct information. No  tool, no correct information, just general knowledge.

So when people talk about AI agents using tools, they are really talking about **bridging the gap between intelligence and action**. Tools are the bridge.

Once you see tools this way, the whole agent idea becomes less mysterious. It is just reasoning plus well-defined abilities, working together to provide a functional, effective system.

### Tools Used by the BYUI Support Agent

The BYUI Support Agent uses the tools defined in the table below:

| **Tool**               | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **Example**                                                      | **Without Tool**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **With Tool**                                                                                                                                                                |
