## Welcome

This section examines the complexities beneath AI systems—the architectural decisions, inherent limitations, and strategic considerations that shape how AI tools perform in production environments. Whether you're evaluating AI integration, designing workflows around LLMs, or managing knowledge infrastructure, these articles provide the technical depth needed to make informed decisions.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers three critical topics for understanding AI implementation at scale:

## Why This Matters

Understanding these advanced concepts enables you to:

- **Design resilient workflows** - Structure AI integration to catch errors before they reach users
- **Evaluate tradeoffs** - Recognize when alignment, convenience, or capability conflicts with accuracy
- **Optimize knowledge infrastructure** - Build documentation systems that improve AI performance by design
- **Anticipate failure modes** - Understand where and why LLMs struggle so you can plan verification steps

## Getting Started

These articles assume familiarity with basic AI concepts like training, RAG, and alignment. If terms like "RLHF" or "vector embeddings" are unfamiliar, start with the Basics section first. Each article is structured for technical readers—expect citations, case studies, and operational recommendations rather than simplified analogies. Together, they provide frameworks for deploying AI systems that are both powerful and trustworthy.
