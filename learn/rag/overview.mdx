## Welcome

This section provides a deep dive into **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**—the core technology that enables the BYU-Idaho Support Agent to provide accurate, institution-specific answers grounded in official documentation. Whether you're curious about how the agent stays current and reliable, or you're building similar AI systems, these guides explain the architecture and techniques behind modern knowledge-enhanced AI.

RAG is what transforms a general-purpose AI model into a specialized assistant that knows BYU-Idaho's policies, procedures, and resources. Instead of relying on training data that may be outdated or generic, RAG systems dynamically retrieve relevant information from curated knowledge bases—then generate responses informed by that specific content.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers three foundational topics that explain how the Support Agent retrieves and uses knowledge:

## Why This Matters

RAG technology is the difference between an AI assistant that guesses and one that knows. Understanding RAG helps you:

- **Appreciate how the Support Agent stays accurate** - See why responses are grounded in real BYU-Idaho documentation
- **Recognize the limitations and strengths** - Understand what RAG can and cannot do
- **Trust the system more confidently** - Know that answers come from verified sources, not improvisation
- **Build better knowledge bases** - If you contribute content, learn how structure affects AI performance

For students and employees, RAG means you get answers based on current, official information. For content creators and developers, RAG represents a proven architectural pattern for building trustworthy AI systems.

## The RAG Advantage

Traditional AI models answer questions based solely on their training data—which has a cutoff date and contains no institution-specific information. The Support Agent uses RAG to overcome these limitations:

- **Current Information**: Answers reflect the latest BYU-Idaho policies and procedures
- **Institution-Specific Knowledge**: Responses draw from actual campus documentation, not generic assumptions
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: The AI retrieves real content before responding, minimizing fabricated information
- **Source Attribution**: Answers can be traced back to specific documents for verification
- **No Retraining Required**: New information becomes available immediately when added to the knowledge base

Without RAG, the Support Agent would be limited to general knowledge about higher education. With RAG, it becomes a specialized assistant that understands BYU-Idaho's unique systems, processes, and culture.

## Getting Started

Each article in this section builds on the previous one, but they're written to be read independently. If you're new to RAG, start with "What is RAG?" to understand the overall concept. If you're curious about the technical infrastructure, jump straight to "Vector Databases" to see how Pinecone powers semantic search.

Together, these articles reveal how the Support Agent delivers accurate answers in seconds—retrieving the right information from thousands of documents, then generating natural, conversational responses that directly address your questions.
