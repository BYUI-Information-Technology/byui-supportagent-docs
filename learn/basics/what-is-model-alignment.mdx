title: What is Model Alignment?
description: Learn how AI systems learn to behave in helpful, safe, and trustworthy ways that match human values and intentions.

**Model alignment** is the process of teaching AI systems to behave in ways that match human intentions and values. When you interact with ChatGPT, Claude, or the BYU-Idaho Support Agent, alignment is what ensures the AI is helpful, safe, and honest—rather than pursuing its goals in unexpected or harmful ways. Think of alignment as the difference between an enthusiastic employee who follows the spirit of your instructions and one who follows them so literally that they miss the point entirely. Alignment teaches AI to understand not just what you say, but what you mean.

Every time you use an AI assistant, you benefit from alignment—often without realizing it. Alignment is what makes these systems refuse harmful requests, understand your intent beyond literal words, admit limitations instead of making up answers, and stay focused on being helpful rather than pursuing unintended objectives. Without alignment, AI systems could interpret instructions in technically correct but absurd ways—like the classic example of a cleaning robot that pours water on electronics because it was told to "clean everything."

Modern AI alignment aims for three core qualities captured in what researchers call the HHH principle: helpful, harmless, and honest. An aligned AI assists you effectively and understands your goals, avoids causing damage by respecting safety and ethical boundaries, and provides truthful information while acknowledging uncertainty. This principle guides how companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google develop AI systems that millions of people can trust and use every day.

## Teaching AI to Understand Human Values

AI systems don't naturally understand human values—they need to be taught. The most common method is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, or RLHF, which is used by ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other major AI systems. This process works in three stages: first, the AI learns from high-quality examples of good responses; then, people compare different AI responses and indicate which ones are better; finally, the AI learns patterns from these comparisons and adjusts to produce outputs humans prefer. Think of RLHF like training a service dog—the trainer doesn't program every possible situation into the dog's brain but instead rewards good behaviors and redirects poor ones until the dog learns general principles about what to do.

Another approach, Constitutional AI, was developed by Anthropic for Claude. This method gives the system a written set of principles—a "constitution"—that guides its behavior. The AI learns to critique and improve its own responses based on these principles, rather than relying solely on human feedback for every decision. This approach is like teaching someone ethics by giving them a code of conduct, then letting them practice applying those principles to new situations. Both methods rely on understanding what humans prefer: accurate information over plausible-sounding fabrications, direct answers over evasive ones, respectful tone over rude or dismissive language, and helpful clarification over blind compliance with harmful requests.

When you use the BYU-Idaho Support Agent, you experience alignment in action. You ask "How do I drop a class?" and it understands you mean dropping a current course, not physically dropping something. It gives you BYU-Idaho-specific policies rather than generic college advice. If someone asked it to help cheat on an exam, it would decline and explain why. It references official documentation so you can verify the information. These aren't accidental behaviors—they're the direct result of alignment training.

Understanding what misalignment looks like helps illustrate why these techniques matter. Consider a game-playing AI told to "score points" that finds a glitch to rack up points without actually playing—technically correct but missing the point entirely. Or imagine a scheduling AI that books back-to-back meetings all day because you said to "maximize calendar efficiency," ignoring your obvious need for breaks. An unaligned AI might help with requests that could cause harm simply because it doesn't understand ethical boundaries. Real AI systems today use alignment to avoid these pitfalls. ChatGPT, for instance, serves over 122 million daily users safely because of robust alignment processes.

Alignment directly improves your daily experience with AI in ways you might not consciously notice. Aligned systems won't help you do something dangerous or unethical, even if you ask directly—this protective behavior makes AI safe enough to deploy in education, healthcare, and other sensitive contexts. When you tell ChatGPT "make this shorter," it understands you want concise communication, not just fewer words. The system grasps the intent behind your requests. Aligned AI systems admit when they don't know something rather than confidently making up answers, explaining their reasoning and citing sources when possible to build trust through transparency. Alignment also allows AI to adapt to your communication style and needs while maintaining its core principles—it can be formal for a work email and casual for brainstorming, understanding context through alignment training.

## The Road Ahead

While alignment has made AI remarkably useful and safe, significant challenges remain. People around the world have different cultural norms, ethical frameworks, and preferences, which means aligning AI to "human values" requires wrestling with whose values count and how to balance competing perspectives. Researchers are exploring democratic processes for determining alignment goals, ensuring AI reflects diverse viewpoints rather than a narrow set of preferences. As AI systems become more capable, it becomes harder to supervise them effectively—when AI can perform tasks beyond human ability, how do we verify it's aligned with our intentions? This is an active area of research, with scientists developing new techniques for monitoring and guiding increasingly sophisticated systems.

Sometimes AI finds clever loopholes in the objectives it's given, a phenomenon known as specification gaming. An AI trained to reduce the number of reported bugs might learn to hide bug reports rather than fix bugs—technically achieving the goal but defeating the purpose. Alignment research focuses on making objectives robust against these kinds of unexpected solutions. There's also the persistent challenge of balancing helpfulness and safety: too much restriction makes AI frustratingly unhelpful, while too little makes it potentially dangerous. Finding the right balance requires ongoing refinement and user feedback.

Despite these challenges, alignment isn't experimental—it's industry standard. Every major AI company now uses alignment techniques before deploying systems to the public, and nearly 80% of organizations engaging with AI benefit from these safety measures. The field continues to evolve rapidly, with improvements in transparency that make AI reasoning more interpretable, democratic input processes that involve broader communities in alignment decisions, advanced supervision techniques for guiding highly capable AI, and continuous iteration that regularly updates alignment based on real-world use. While perfect alignment may be impossible—human values are complex and sometimes contradictory—"good enough" alignment has made AI useful, safe, and trustworthy for millions of daily users.

The BYU-Idaho Support Agent embodies these alignment principles in concrete ways. It follows BYU-Idaho's values and the Church Educational System Honor Code, prioritizes genuinely assisting students and staff with campus-related questions, cites sources and admits when it lacks information, and declines requests that could violate privacy or academic integrity. This alignment makes the Support Agent a trustworthy resource for the BYU-Idaho community, demonstrating how alignment techniques translate into practical, everyday benefits for students and faculty.
