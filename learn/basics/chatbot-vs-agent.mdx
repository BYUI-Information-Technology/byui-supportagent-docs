Artificial intelligence has rapidly evolved in the past few years from simple deterministic chatbots based off predifned scripts to impressive generative AI models that understand user intent and can respond with a level of intelligence similar to a human with a Phd.

# What is a Chatbot?

Traditional chatbots operate on simple rules and pre-written scripts. They work by matching keywords in your message to predetermined responses. If you type a phrase the system recognizes, you receive the corresponding answer. If you phrase your question differently or ask something unexpected, the chatbot often struggles.

## **Characteristics of traditional chatbots:**

- Follow rigid, if-then rules (if user says X, respond with Y)
- Cannot reason through unfamiliar questions
- Limited to scenarios their programmers anticipated
- Provide generic responses regardless of context
- Cannot access external information or take actions on your behalf

Think of automated phone systems that ask you to "press 1 for billing" or basic FAQ bots that only recognize exact phrases. These systems serve a purpose, but their capabilities are narrow.

# What is an AI Agent?

Agents, like the BYUI Support Agent, operate as a system that can reason, retrieve information, and take meaningful action. Rather than matching words to a script, it understands user intent, searches official information, and formulates a response grounded in accurate, up-to-date information.

# A Simple Analogy

Consider the difference between a vending machine and a helpful employee.

A **vending machine** offers fixed options. Press a button, receive the corresponding item. If what you need is not on the menu, you are out of luck.

A **helpful employee** listens to your situation, thinks through your options, consults resources, takes action on your behalf, and knows when to bring in a colleague with more expertise.

Traditional chatbots function like vending machines. The BYUI Support Agent functions like a knowledgeable, resourceful employee—one who is available around the clock and backed by BYU-Idaho's official knowledge base.
