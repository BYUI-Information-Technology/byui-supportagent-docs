## History

Founded in 1888 as Bannock Stake Academy, the institution has served students in eastern Idaho for over 135 years. After operating as Ricks College for much of the 20th century, the institution became Brigham Young University-Idaho in 2000, expanding its mission to offer bachelor's and graduate degrees while maintaining its commitment to accessible, high-quality education.

## Mission Statement

  Brigham Young University-Idaho was founded and is supported and guided by The
  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Its mission is to develop
  disciples of Jesus Christ who are leaders in their homes, the Church, and
  their communities.

The university does this by:

- Building testimonies of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and fostering its principles in a wholesome academic, cultural, and social environment.
- Providing a high-quality education that prepares students of diverse interests and abilities for lifelong learning and employment.
