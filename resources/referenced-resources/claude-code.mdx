## Quick Start

Once you've accepted the email invite to join the BYU-Idaho IT org, you're ready to get started installing Claude Code on your machine. Just follow these steps!

1. **Install Claude Code**

   To install Claude Code, use one of the following methods:

   <Tabs>
     <Tab title="macOS, Linux">
       **Native Install (recommended):**

       ```

       **Homebrew:**

       ```bash
       brew install --cask claude-code
       ```
     </Tab>
     <Tab title="Windows">
       **PowerShell:**

2. **Run Claude Code**

   Navigate to the directory you wish on your device using the `cd` command and run Claude with the simple `claude` command.

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   claude
   ```
3. **Configure Preferences**

   You'll be prompted to configure your preferences on first use. Simply follow the on-screen prompts. Don't stress about the preferences, you can always dial them in and adjust them again later, especially as your preferences change (likely will).

## Ways to use Claude Code

- **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
- **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
- **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your team's codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with [MCP](/en/mcp) can pull from external data sources. 
- **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
