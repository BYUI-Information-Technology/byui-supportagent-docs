<Note>
  **Prerequisite**: Must be a member of the IT organization at BYU-Idaho with an
  active license granted by the system admin for Claude (Ron Vallejo).
</Note>

## Quick Start

Once you've accepted the email invite to join the BYU-Idaho IT org, you're ready to get started installing Claude Code on your machine. Just follow these steps!

<Warning>
  **Windows users**: You must open PowerShell **as Administrator** to install Node.js and Git. Right-click the Start menu and select **Terminal (Admin)** or search for "PowerShell", right-click it, and choose **Run as administrator**.

  If you see an execution policy error like `running scripts is disabled on this system`, run this command first in your admin PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

  Then retry the install command.

  After installing Node.js and Git, **close and reopen your terminal** so the updated PATH takes effect. If you skip this, commands like `node` and `git` won't be recognized.
</Warning>

### 1. Install Node.js

Claude Code requires Node.js (version 18 or higher). Check if you already have it installed:

```bash
node --version
```

If you see a version number (e.g., `v22.x.x`), you're good to go. If not, install it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    **Homebrew (recommended):**

    ```bash
    brew install node
    ```

    If you don't have Homebrew, install it first by visiting [brew.sh](https://brew.sh).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    **winget:**

    ```powershell
    winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
    ```

    Alternatively, download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Install Git

Git is essential for version control and is used by Claude Code to track changes. Check if you already have it installed:

```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number, you're set. If not, install it:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```

    This installs Git along with other developer tools. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    **winget:**

    ```powershell
    winget install Git.Git
    ```

    Alternatively, download the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com). During installation, the default settings are fine.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Install Claude Code

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    **Native Install (recommended):**

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
    ```

    **Homebrew:**

    ```bash
    brew install --cask claude-code
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    **PowerShell:**

    ```powershell
    irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
    ```

    **CMD:**

    ```batch
    curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 4. Run Claude Code

Navigate to the directory you wish on your device using the `cd` command and run Claude with the simple `claude` command.

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

### 5. Configure Preferences

You'll be prompted to configure your preferences on first use. Simply follow the on-screen prompts. Don't stress about the preferences, you can always dial them in and adjust them again later, especially as your preferences change (likely will).

### 6. Login

Select the "**Anthropic Console account**" login method. You'll be redirected to the web to login and authorize your account. Make sure to select **Authorize**.

## Setup project "memory" (CLAUDE.md)

Once you have installed, configured, and authenticated into Claude Code, you're ready to begin using Claude in your terminal. To be successful, you need to setup your project "memory". This is a simple Markdown document (`CLAUDE.md`) that sits in your project's root directory.

To configure your CLAUDE.md document, simply have Claude help you!

Run:

```bash
/init
```

mkdir your-project

❯ 1. Yes, I trust this folder

For example:

```txt
your-project/
├── apps/
│    ├── backend/         # Python (of course)
│    └── frontend/        # TypeScript
├── release/              # Release notes (cause you should)
└── CLAUDE.md             # Main project instructions

```

## Ways to use Claude Code

- **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
- **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Claude Code will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
- **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your team's codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project structure, can find up-to-date information from the web, and with [MCP](/en/mcp) can pull from external data sources.
- **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix fiddly lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.
