## Our Objectives

In order to successfully implement this initiative, the following primary objectives are essential:

- **Build agent-centric**: Build a future-proof, agentic system that can extend to additional departments and integrate with core BYUI systems
- **Align with BYU-Idaho Values**: Build an agent that is aligned with the values of BYU-Idaho, including the Honor Code, and is designed to help students and employees at BYU-Idaho
- **Be Measurable**: Build a platform that is measurable, allowing us to evaluate system performance and make data-driven decisions

## Future Expansion

The Support Agent is designed as a platform that can grow with the university's needs. Future phases may include:

- **Department-specific agents**: Specialized sub-agents for Financial Aid, Admissions, Student Records, and Advising
- **Enhanced integrations**: Direct connections to more campus systems for automated task completion
- **Expanded capabilities**: Proactive notifications, appointment scheduling, and personalized recommendations
- **Cross-department collaboration**: Multiple department agents working together to solve complex student needs

The modular architecture ensures that new capabilities can be added without disrupting existing functionality.
